# 📊 Sales Performance Analysis (MS Excel Project)

This project is a dynamic and interactive **Sales Performance Analysis** built using **Microsoft Excel**, designed to analyze and visualize key business metrics from a fictional Superstore dataset. The dashboard provides deep insights into **sales, profit, customer behavior, and regional performance**, all structured for business decision-making.

> ✅ Ideal for beginners who want to learn Excel analytics, or recruiters evaluating entry-level data analysts.

## 🧠 Objective of the Project

To simulate the role of a **Business Analyst** or **Excel Data Analyst** by creating a professional dashboard that:

- Monitors key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Identifies trends across time, regions, and product categories
- Enables decision-making using **filters (slicers)** and interactive visuals

## 📁 Project Structure

### ➤ `Superstore_Data.xlsx`
This is the **raw dataset** that includes:
- Order ID, Product Name, Category, Sub-category
- Sales Amount, Profit, Quantity
- Region, State, Customer Name
- Order Date, Ship Mode

It mimics real-world sales data typically used by e-commerce or retail businesses.

### ➤ `Sales_Dashboard_Excel.xlsx`
This is the **final dashboard file** containing:
- Cleaned and structured data (no code, all Excel formulas)
- Pivot Tables for aggregation
- Pivot Charts for visuals
- Slicers for user-friendly filtering
- Conditional formatting for visual emphasis

---

## 🔍 Key Features of the Dashboard

### 🔹 **1. Key Metrics (KPIs)**
The top section of the dashboard shows:
- **Total Sales** – Total revenue generated
- **Total Profit** – Net profit across all orders
- **Total Quantity Sold** – Units sold
- **Average Profit per Order**

✅ All KPIs are auto-updated based on slicer selection (dynamic filtering).

### 🔹 **2. Sales by Region**
- A **Pivot Chart (Column Chart)** shows how each region contributes to total sales.
- Helps identify high-performing and underperforming regions.
- Useful for market expansion or resource allocation strategies.

---

### 🔹 **3. Monthly Sales Trends**
- A **Pivot Line Chart** visualizes **Sales by Month**.
- Shows **seasonality, spikes, or dips** in sales.
- Helps identify promotional impact or time-based trends.

---

### 🔹 **4. Product Category & Sub-Category Analysis**
- Bar chart comparing **Sales and Profit by Category**
- Drill-down into **Sub-Categories** to find which products drive revenue or profit.
- Helps in stock planning or discount strategies.

---

### 🔹 **5. Top Customers**
- A **Pivot Table** ranks customers by total purchases.
- Helps identify loyal or high-value customers.
- Enables targeted marketing or loyalty rewards planning.

---

### 🔹 **6. Interactive Slicers**
